#summary First steps

== Introduction ==

This document contains notes on building, configuring, running and testing the server. 

=== Getting the code === 

Get the code from svn:
{{{ 
svn co http://erlycomet.googlecode.com/svn/trunk erlycomet
}}}
=== Compiling and configuring the server ===
{{{ 
cd erlycomet
make 
}}}
=== Running the server === 
{{{ 
make run
}}}
This will start the server on Port 3000 and in an interactive erlang shell. 
If you want to use a different port, then you have to edit the file `erlycomet.app` in the `ebin` directory. Ports < 1024 are currently not supported.

=== Examples and demos (straight from http://dojotoolkit.org and http://cometd.com) ===

 * Chat: http://localhost:3000/dijit/demos/chat.html *(not functional yet !!!)*

 * SimpleChat: http://localhost:3000/simplechat/index.html *(not functional yet !!!)*

 * Echo: http://localhost:3000/echo/index.html *(not functional yet !!!)*

 * PongGame: http://localhost:3000/dojopong/game.html *(doesn't even load !!!)*

=== Regenerating the documentation ===

`make doc` does currently not work, run from the Erlang shell:
{{{ 
edoc:application('ErlyComet', ".", [no_packages]). 
}}}
