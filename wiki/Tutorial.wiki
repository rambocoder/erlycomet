#summary First steps

== Introduction ==

This document contains notes on building, configuring, running and testing the server. 

=== Getting the code === 

Get the code from svn:
{{{ 
svn co http://erlycomet.googlecode.com/svn/trunk erlycomet
}}}
=== Compiling and configuring the server ===
{{{ 
cd erlycomet
make 
}}}
=== Running the server === 
{{{ 
make run
}}}
This will start the server on Port 3000 and in an interactive erlang shell. 
If you want to use a different port, then you have to edit the file `erlycomet.app` in the `ebin` directory. Ports < 1024 are currently not supported.

= Demo =

Check the server status on the interactive Erlang shell:
{{{
(erlycomet@roberto-saccons-computer)1> erlycomet_demo:status().
Connections: []
ok
(erlycomet@roberto-saccons-computer)2>
}}}

Start first client: http://localhost:3000/index.html

Check the server status again, you should see now one connection:
{{{
(erlycomet@roberto-saccons-computer)2> erlycomet_demo:status().
Connections: [{"3855F37603188BD7D3F703A240174C9",<0.101.0>}]
ok
(erlycomet@roberto-saccons-computer)3> 
}}}

If you leave the browser window open, after a (currently hard-coded) timeout of 20 minutes the server closes the connection.


=== Notes for ErlyComet contributors: ===

Regenerating the documentation:

`make doc` does currently not work, run from the Erlang shell:
{{{ 
edoc:application('ErlyComet', ".", [no_packages]). 
}}}
